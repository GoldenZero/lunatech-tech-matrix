TO DO:

Current API modification:
- add documentation (comments)
- case sensitive check of tech name (introduce lower name)
- finish the skill and tech API operations
    FIX THE UPDATE IN SKILLMATRIX AND TECHDAO SERVICE
    DONE: name of users in result
    DONE: get user skill - modify return type
    DONE: get the skill matrix
    DONE: get info about one tech (user and level info)
    DONE: return the correct resource for the create skill operation
    DONE: implement the techDAOService.updateTech method
    return the correct resource for the update operation
    rethink the way we now handle the return types of the endpoint.
